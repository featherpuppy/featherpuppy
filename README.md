# About me

I am an undergraduate student in computer science at UNSW! I also really like physics, ecology, palaeontology, philosophy, art, and the list is endless.
I also have a Diploma in Science from the University of New England (Australia) where I mostly did classes in palaeobiology.

I am new to GitHub and am still figuring out how to navigate and use it properly.
I will probably update this and make it better later.
